 #This is the beginning of the R programming Alissa can do after getting certified from Google analytics course. R programming is super fun and i personally like R programming better than SQL#
 
 Hi m name is Alissa Williams I am currently interested in breaking into the tech industry with my new found data analyst skills and willing to learn more programs backend frount end softwares.
 I learned SQL and R Program recently. SQL is many facuets to it, although it is a good base, when I learned R i really caught on quickly, then I had to relearn SQL the same way I understood R. I understand Python is another popular kid on the block to learn and another building block whick I plan on learning as well with some Microsoft programming courses as well.
 Here are some basic functions I can do for my portfolio my coding speed and typing speed car COMPLETELY different, I'm so much more slower coding and a decent WPM for typing lol but i hope with more experience I can be like the Wizard from the frist Matrix.
 Thank You!
